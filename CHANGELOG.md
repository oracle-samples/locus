## [Unreleased]

### Changed — tutorial renumber + Oracle-first reordering

Renumbered every `examples/tutorial_NN_*.py` and its matching
`docs/tutorials/tutorial_NN_*.md` so the numbers reflect suggested
reading order, not historical order of authorship.

- **Tutorials 01–05 are now the OCI Generative AI section** (inference
  platform): OCI transports, OCIOpenAIModel, OCIResponsesModel, DAC,
  Cohere Reranker V4.
- **Tutorials 06–07 are now the Oracle Database 26ai section** (data
  layer): native `VECTOR(N, FLOAT32)` RAG and durable agent-thread
  checkpointer in Autonomous Database.
- **08–15 Foundations** (basic agent → termination conditions)
- **16–23 Graphs & composition**
- **24–34 Multi-agent**
- **35–37 Reasoning & structured output**
- **38–40 RAG**
- **41–45 Skills, playbooks, plugins**
- **46–51 Production**
- **52–56 Cognitive router & observability**
- **57–61 Real-world workflows**
- **62–63 Server + full pipelines**

Every cross-reference was updated: `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/tutorials/index.md`,
`docs/index.md`, README, all `docs/concepts/*` and `docs/how-to/*` pages,
and the integration test file (renamed from `test_tutorials_13_21.py` to
`test_tutorials_subset.py`).

Embedded references migrated to match the new numbers: database table
names (`locus_tutorial_NN_*`), thread IDs, audio asset filenames
(`tutorial_60_response.mp3`, `tutorial_61_question.wav`,
`tutorial_61_answer.wav`), and `Tutorial NN` headers inside each file.

### Changed — `config.py` now defaults to OCI Generative AI

`examples/config.py` auto-detects the provider: OCI Generative AI when
`~/.oci/config` (or `LOCUS_OCI_AUTH_TYPE=instance_principal` /
`resource_principal`) is available, the bundled `MockModel` otherwise.
This means developer laptops with OCI configured run every tutorial
against live OCI with zero setup; clean CI machines still get the
mock model. Set `LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER` explicitly to force a choice.

`examples/.env.example` was reorganised to lead with the OCI section.

## [0.2.0b16] - 2026-05-18

This release closes every issue in the 2026-05-18 audit feedback set
(#213–#220) plus a Cohere reranker integration (#216) and the test
plumbing follow-up to the b15 release. Seven PRs landed since b15:
PR #221, PR #222, PR #223, PR #224, PR #225, PR #226, PR #227.

### Added — Cohere Reranker V4 for retrieve-then-rerank RAG (closes #216)

`locus.rag.reranker.Reranker` ABC + `CohereReranker` against OCI
GenAI's `cohere.rerank-v4.0-fast` on the on-demand wire in
`us-chicago-1`. Wires into `RAGRetriever(reranker=..., rerank_candidate_pool=50)`
so calls over-fetch from the vector store, rerank with a cross-encoder,
and trim to the user-requested limit. Reranker score lands on
`SearchResult.score`; embedding score preserved on `.distance` so
callers can compare both signals.

```python
from locus.rag import CohereReranker, RAGRetriever

retriever = RAGRetriever(
    embedder=embedder,
    store=store,
    reranker=CohereReranker(
        model="cohere.rerank-v4.0-fast",
        compartment_id=compartment,
        profile_name="DEFAULT",
        region="us-chicago-1",
        top_n=5,
    ),
    rerank_candidate_pool=50,
)
hits = await retriever.retrieve("hepcidin in iron homeostasis", limit=5)
```

Reuses `OCIClient` internally so every auth mode (api_key /
security_token / session_token / instance & resource principal) works
without duplicating the signer plumbing.

- New tutorial: [`tutorial_05_cohere_reranker.py`](examples/tutorial_05_cohere_reranker.py)
  — runnable end-to-end demo against OCI.
- New workbench pattern: `cohere_reranker` (id `Retrieve-then-rerank
  (Cohere V4)`) reachable at `POST /api/run/cohere_reranker`.
- Docs: new "Reranking — Cohere V4 cross-encoder" section in
  `docs/concepts/rag.md`.

### Added — `GraphRunnable` adapter (closes #213)

Publish a Graph as an Agent / A2A server with one line — the same
`AgentServer` / `A2AServer` machinery that Agents have always used.

```python
from locus.multiagent.graph import StateGraph
from locus.server import AgentServer, GraphRunnable
from locus.a2a import A2AServer, AgentSkill

graph = StateGraph(...).compile()
runnable = GraphRunnable(graph, input_key="prompt", output_key="answer")

AgentServer(agent=runnable).run(port=8000)
A2AServer(agent=runnable, api_key="...", skills=[...]).run(port=7421)
```

`GraphRunnable` builds `{input_key: prompt}`, drives `graph.stream(inputs)`,
translates each intermediate `StreamEvent` to a `ThinkEvent` (SSE
consumers see node-by-node progress), and the terminal final-state
event to a `TerminateEvent` with `final_message = final_state[output_key]`.
Duck-typed — any object with `stream(inputs) -> AsyncIterator` works.

### Fixed — A2A AgentCard advertises bearer auth (closes #214)

`A2AServer._build_card` now populates `securitySchemes` +
`security` when `api_key` is configured (or `LOCUS_A2A_API_KEY` is
set). Peers can discover the auth requirement from
`/.well-known/agent-card.json` instead of finding out via a 401 on
the first call. In `allow_unauthenticated=True` mode both fields stay
`null` so the open mode is detectable by absence.

### Added — env-var fallback `LOCUS_OCI_* → OCI_*` (closes #218)

`examples/config.py` now resolves every OCI setting through a single
`_oci_env(name, default)` helper:

```
LOCUS_OCI_<NAME>  →  OCI_<NAME>  →  default
```

So a user who's already run `oci session authenticate --profile-name
DEFAULT` and exported `OCI_PROFILE` can run any tutorial without
re-exporting variables. `LOCUS_OCI_*` still wins when set, preserving
the existing use case where a tutorial points at a different profile
from the user's shell-default OCI config. New docs page:
[`docs/how-to/environment-variables.md`](docs/how-to/environment-variables.md).

### Docs — OracleVectorStore production setup + tutorial 22 listing (closes #215, #217)

- `OracleVectorStore` docstring rewritten: dropped `user="ADMIN"`
  everywhere (Oracle security anti-pattern), introduced a
  `locus_app` least-privileged schema, documented the auto-vs-pre-create
  table provisioning matrix (`auto_create_table=True` for demos with
  DDL; `False` for production with pre-created table + DML-only privs).
  CREATE USER / GRANT script + ready-to-paste CREATE TABLE + CREATE
  VECTOR INDEX in both the docstring and `docs/concepts/rag.md`.
- Tutorial 22 (`using_vector_stores`) now lists `OracleVectorStore`
  alongside the InMemory / Qdrant / OpenSearch / pgvector / Chroma
  options.
- Three deep-research demos and the project README now default
  `ADB_USER` to `locus_app` (back-compat preserved — explicit
  `ADB_USER=ADMIN` still works).

### Docs — README + examples use canonical import paths (closes #219, #220)

- 47 files swept (`README.md`, `examples/`, `docs/`): every
  `from locus import X` shorthand replaced with the canonical
  package path (`from locus.agent import Agent`,
  `from locus.tools import tool`, etc.). The shorthand worked via
  `locus/__init__.py`'s lazy `__getattr__` mapping but Pyright /
  VS Code can't follow it; canonical paths resolve statically.
- `examples/config.py` corrected: `OCIOpenAIModel` is imported from
  `locus.models.providers.oci`, not `locus.models`.
- README's "The cognitive router" section now demonstrates an actual
  `Router` (`GoalFrame` extractor + `ProtocolRegistry` +
  `CognitiveCompiler`) instead of the unrelated `create_research_workflow`
  it accidentally showed before.

### Tests — model swap + tutorial_59 timeout (closes #225 work)

- Parallel-tool-calls matrix swapped `xai.grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`
  (was hitting team-level RPM under back-to-back sweeps) for
  `openai.gpt-4.1` — frontier OpenAI, different rate-limit pool, same
  OpenAI-compat tool_calls codepath.
- `test_tutorials_all_live._TUTORIAL_TIMEOUT_OVERRIDES` adds a
  per-tutorial budget. `tutorial_34_emergent_routing` lifted from 360s
  → 900s (legitimately takes ~10 min under the reasoning model with 5
  dispatches × ≥3 LLM calls each).

## [0.2.0b15] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed — `tool_execution="concurrent"` actually runs in parallel (closes #210)

The runtime loop was feeding `ConcurrentExecutor` one tool call at a time
inside a `for` loop, so `asyncio.gather` only ever saw a singleton list —
`tool_execution="concurrent"` was silently identical to `"sequential"`.
A model emitting 100 MCP tool calls in one response took ~30s of wall
time instead of the expected ~1s.

`src/locus/agent/runtime_loop.py` is now split into three phases:

- **Phase 1 (per call, serial):** emit `ToolStartEvent`, run before-hooks,
  resolve cancel / idempotent-cache short-circuits into a `slots[]` array.
- **Phase 2 (one batched call):** stream the survivors through the
  executor's new `execute_streaming()` method — completion order on
  `ConcurrentExecutor`, input order on `SequentialExecutor`.
- **Phase 3 (per result, tool_call order):** truncation / offload, state
  update, `ToolCompleteEvent`, after-hooks (with retry), write /
  verification tracking.

Same refactor restores **within-batch idempotent dedup**: if a model
emits `[submit_invoice(X), submit_invoice(X), submit_invoice(X)]` in one
response, the body fires exactly once. Cross-iteration dedup (the
README hero case) is unchanged. Backed by `_idempotent_batch_key()` +
a `batch_cache_ref` slot kind that resolves from the first slot's
result in Phase 3.

### Added — opt-in completion-order event streaming + interrupt-driven sibling cancellation

- **`AgentConfig.tool_event_order: Literal["sequential", "completion"]`**
  (default `"sequential"`). In completion mode, `ToolCompleteEvent` fires
  the moment each tool finishes (in completion order); in sequential
  mode (default) events still arrive in tool_call order after the whole
  batch — preserving existing consumer assumptions.
  `state.tool_executions` order stays in tool_call order in both modes.

- **`ToolExecutor.execute_streaming()`** added to the ABC with a default
  fallback to `execute()` + yield-in-input-order.
  `ConcurrentExecutor.execute_streaming` overrides with a
  `create_task` + queue + per-task `finally` stop-marker pattern
  (chosen over `asyncio.TaskGroup`, which deadlocks the streaming
  consumer when a producer is cancelled because the cancelled task
  never puts on the queue). `SequentialExecutor.execute_streaming` is
  a simple for-loop yield.

- **Interrupt mid-batch now actively cancels in-flight siblings.** When
  a tool returns the `__interrupt__` marker, the runtime loop breaks
  out of the streaming `async for`, which triggers the executor's
  `finally` to cancel still-in-flight sibling tasks. Pre-fix, siblings
  completed in parallel under `gather` and only the post-batch fold
  was halted — side effects already landed.

### Files touched

- `src/locus/agent/runtime_loop.py` — three-phase split + within-batch
  dedup + `execute_streaming` consumer + interrupt-driven cancel.
- `src/locus/tools/executor.py` — `ToolExecutor.execute_streaming()`
  ABC method + `ConcurrentExecutor` / `SequentialExecutor` overrides.
- `src/locus/agent/config.py` — `tool_event_order` field.

## [0.2.0b14] - 2026-05-16

### Added — session-token disk reload + refresh observability on `OCIRequestSigner`

Two improvements to the OCI auth path, closing gaps surfaced by an audit
against the `oci-genai-auth` reference (oracle-samples/oci-genai-auth-python).

- **Session-token signers now auto-refresh from disk.** When the
  config profile carries a `security_token_file`, the auth flow now
  re-reads that file on the 10-minute periodic-refresh tick and on a
  401 response, then rebuilds the underlying `SecurityTokenSigner`. So
  if `oci session refresh` (or any external token-rotation daemon)
  updates the file, the next signed request picks up the new token
  without a process restart. Previously the `SecurityTokenSigner` was
  immutable and locus had no rebuild path, meaning laptop dev sessions
  on a session-token profile silently 401'd after the token's TTL
  expired (~1h on a typical OCI session).

- **`OCIRequestSigner.last_refresh_error` is now publicly readable.**
  When `_do_refresh` previously swallowed an exception (to keep using
  the old signer rather than crashing), there was no programmatic way
  to spot that refresh had been failing for hours. The new attribute
  exposes the last refresh exception (or `None` on success / never
  refreshed), and refresh outcomes are also emitted via the module
  logger so operators can grep pod logs.

- **`OCIRequestSigner` refresh callback contract widened.** The
  callback can now optionally return a *new* signer instance (instead
  of mutating the current one in place); the wrapper detects this via
  `hasattr(result, "do_request_sign")` and swaps `self._signer` to it.
  Backwards compatible: existing in-place mutators (instance/resource
  principal `refresh_security_token`) keep working unchanged.

- `src/locus/models/providers/oci/_signing.py` — `last_refresh_error`
  attribute + `last_refresh_error` property, refresh-result logging,
  signer-swap on non-None callback return.
- `src/locus/models/providers/oci/openai_compat.py` — `_refresh_callable_for`
  takes optional `profile` / `config_file` kwargs and, for
  `SecurityTokenSigner` signers, returns a closure that re-reads the
  `security_token_file` from disk and yields a fresh
  `SecurityTokenSigner`. `OCIOpenAIModel.client` plumbs the kwargs.
- `src/locus/models/providers/oci/responses.py` — same plumbing on the
  Responses transport so both paths get session-token disk reload.
- `tests/unit/test_oci_signer_refresh_observability.py` — 9 cases
  covering the new last_refresh_error attribute, swap-on-new-signer
  contract, in-place-mutation backward compat, end-to-end disk
  round-trip, and the guard paths that disable refresh when profile
  context is missing.

## [0.2.0b13] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed — OCI instance-principal token now auto-refreshes on both openai-style HTTP transports

`OCIOpenAIModel` (behind every `oci:openai.<model>` / `oci:google.<model>` id)
**and** `OCIResponsesModel` (the `/v1/responses` transport) were both
constructing their `OCIRequestSigner` without passing a `refresh_signer`
callback. `OCIRequestSigner.auth_flow` has a refresh-on-401 branch *and*
a periodic-refresh branch — both early-return when `refresh_signer is None`,
which meant the federation token captured at process start was used
forever. On OKE, instance-principal tokens expire on the order of 15–30
minutes, so any agent pod older than that would 401 on every GenAI call
until restarted.

Production symptom: chats silently fall through to `reason=error` after
~15 minutes of pod uptime, with httpx logs showing
`HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized` on every `chat.completions` /
`/v1/responses` call. Pod restart was the only known workaround.

The fix wires the signer's own `refresh_security_token` method (present
on `InstancePrincipalsSecurityTokenSigner`, `get_resource_principals_signer()`
returns a signer with the same contract, and any `DelegationTokenSigner`
variant that follows the OCI SDK convention) into the wrapper via a new
`_refresh_callable_for(signer)` helper exported from `openai_compat.py`
and reused by `responses.py`. Static signers (user-principal API key)
have no `refresh_security_token` attribute and the helper returns
`None`, so the refresh path stays dormant for them.
`refresh_interval` is tightened from the upstream 3600 s default to
600 s — short enough that proactive refresh beats the typical 15–30
minute federation-token TTL even if a 401 doesn't fire first.

**Scope of the fix.** Two transports use the httpx + `OCIRequestSigner`
wrapper and are both patched here. Other OCI transports route signing
through `oci.generative_ai_inference.GenerativeAiInferenceClient`,
which delegates to the OCI Python SDK's built-in HTTP client and
already refreshes federation tokens internally — those are unaffected
by this bug:

| Transport | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `OCIOpenAIModel` (Chat Completions) | `src/locus/models/providers/oci/openai_compat.py` | Fixed |
| `OCIResponsesModel` (`/v1/responses`) | `src/locus/models/providers/oci/responses.py` | Fixed |
| `OCIModel` (native OCI SDK) | `src/locus/models/providers/oci/client.py` | Unaffected (OCI SDK refresh) |
| `OracleGenAIEmbeddings` (RAG) | `src/locus/rag/embeddings/oci.py` | Unaffected (OCI SDK refresh) |

No public-API change; the wiring is internal.

- `src/locus/models/providers/oci/openai_compat.py` — new
  `_refresh_callable_for(signer)` helper; `OCIOpenAIModel.client` now
  passes `refresh_signer=_refresh_callable_for(signer)` and
  `refresh_interval=600.0` when constructing `OCIRequestSigner`.
- `src/locus/models/providers/oci/responses.py` — `OCIResponsesModel._http_client`
  imports `_refresh_callable_for` from `openai_compat` and uses the
  same `refresh_signer=_refresh_callable_for(signer)` +
  `refresh_interval=600.0` wiring so the Responses-API transport
  gets the same long-lived federation-token handling.
- `tests/unit/test_oci_openai_compat.py` — `TestRefreshCallableFor`
  (3 cases) and `TestClientWiresRefreshSigner` (2 cases) cover the
  helper and the openai-compat wiring.
- `tests/unit/test_oci_responses_model.py` — `TestHttpClientWiresRefreshSigner`
  (2 cases) covers the `OCIResponsesModel` wiring with the same contract.

## [0.2.0b12] - 2026-05-16

### Added — `datastores=` parity on `create_research_workflow`

`create_research_workflow` now accepts the same `datastores={name: {retriever, description, top_k, threshold}}`
mapping as `create_deepagent`. Both factories share a `wire_datastores(...)`
helper so the execute agent of either path gets an identical `search_<name>`
tool surface plus a per-store routing block prepended to the system prompt.

This closes the only remaining surface gap between the two research
factories — recipes that ran on `create_deepagent(datastores=...)`
translate to the StateGraph-with-grounding-loop variant verbatim.

```python
workflow = create_research_workflow(
    model=...,
    tools=[],
    output_schema=Report,
    datastores={"medical": {"retriever": medical_retriever, "top_k": 6}},
    grounding_threshold=0.65,
)
```

- `src/locus/deepagent/factory.py` — extracted the auto-wiring logic
  into a new public `wire_datastores(datastores, datastore_top_k) ->
  (tools, routing_block)` helper. `create_deepagent` now calls it
  (semantics unchanged from b11).
- `src/locus/deepagent/workflow.py` — `create_research_workflow` gains
  `datastores=` and `datastore_top_k=` kwargs; the execute node sees
  the merged tool list and the prepended routing block.
- `docs/concepts/deepagent.md` — workflow `datastores=` example +
  cross-reference under "When to use each".
- `tests/unit/test_research_workflow_datastores.py` — 8 cases covering
  `None`/empty input, bare-retriever vs dict form, multi-store routing,
  `TypeError` on bad value types, and end-to-end workflow construction
  with a configured datastore.

## [0.2.0b11] - 2026-05-16

### Added — `create_deepagent(datastores=...)` + seven deep-research locus demos

`create_deepagent` now accepts a `datastores={name: {retriever, description, top_k, threshold}}`
mapping and auto-wires a `search_<name>` tool for each entry, plus a per-store routing block
prepended to the system prompt so the model picks the right store per query. Mirrors the
`langchain-oci.create_deep_research_agent(datastores=...)` shape so existing recipes translate 1:1.
Closes [#202](https://github.com/oracle-samples/locus/issues/202).

- **API surface.** `from locus.deepagent import create_deepagent` —
  `datastores=` accepts either a bare `RAGRetriever` or the dict form
  `{retriever, description, top_k, threshold}`. The store name
  interpolates into both the tool name (`search_medical`) and the
  routing block in the system prompt.
- **`OracleVectorStore` column overrides.** `id_column`, `content_column`,
  `embedding_column`, `metadata_column`, `created_at_column` (set to
  `None` to skip), and `auto_create_table=False` for attaching to
  existing tables written by other ingestion pipelines (e.g.
  `langchain_oracledb.vectorstores.OracleVS` writes `text` instead of
  `content`). Lets locus read a foreign-schema ADB table without
  re-ingestion.
- **`cohere.embed-v4.0` dimension auto-detect.** The embedding-model
  registry now treats `MODEL_DIMENSION_HINTS` as a hint table — models
  not present in it discover their dimension via a one-shot probe call
  at first use. New models work without an explicit entry.
- **Defensive `float`/`int` coercion in the retrieval path.** Some
  providers (notably `gpt-5.x`) JSON-encode tool args as strings —
  `"min_score": "0.5"` rather than `0.5`. `RAGRetriever.retrieve` and
  `OracleVectorStore.search` now coerce defensively so the downstream
  `score < threshold` comparison never sees a string and never raises
  `TypeError`.

### Added — `examples/projects/deep-research/`

Seven runnable demos that mirror upstream langchain-oci deep-research
gists 1:1 on locus primitives, covering every retrieval backend locus
supports:

| Demo | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `demo_hello_world.py` | none — `@tool` functions | Sanity check for `create_deepagent` |
| `demo_smoke.py` | `InMemoryVectorStore` | No-DB end-to-end RAG smoke |
| `demo_iron_metabolism.py` | Oracle Autonomous DB (241-doc corpus) | `gpt-5.1 @ 65K`; prints retrieved snippets and citation density |
| `demo_memory_multi_turn.py` | ADB + `locus.memory.InMemoryStore` | Two-turn agent with response capture |
| `demo_multi_datastore.py` | Two ADB vector tables | Cross-domain routing via `datastores={medical, news}` |
| `demo_opensearch_multi_index.py` | Two OpenSearch indices | Same shape against `OpenSearchVectorStore` |
| `demo_object_storage.py` | OCI Object Storage `@tool` wrappers | `list_bucket_objects` / `read_bucket_object` / `search_bucket_data` |

The README documents the langchain-oci → locus translation table,
runtime gotchas (`InMemoryStore` is async; `AsyncOpenSearch` clients
need awaited operations; from inside an event loop use
`async for event in agent.run(...)` instead of `agent.run_sync(...)`),
and verified output stats from a real ADB run.

### Added — documentation

- `docs/concepts/deepagent.md` — new "Datastore auto-wiring" section
  with an Oracle Autonomous DB example and the provider-quirk +
  async-loop notes.
- `docs/tutorials/tutorial_29_deepagent.md` — topic 6 cross-references
  the deep-research project for the multi-backend variants.
- `docs/workbench.md` and `workbench/README.md` — cross-references
  under "What you can run" so workbench users discover the project
  examples.
- `examples/tutorial_29_deepagent.py` — new `part5_datastores()` that
  exercises `create_deepagent(datastores=...)` against an in-memory
  `RAGRetriever`, so the workbench picks the tutorial up and demos
  the auto-wiring without external dependencies.

### Fixed — embedding-config rename, ratchet refresh, docs audit

- `MODEL_DIMENSIONS` constant renamed to `MODEL_DIMENSION_HINTS` (keys
  are now model_id strings rather than enum members). Old internal
  callers updated; `test_model_dimensions` aligned.
- Coverage ratchet baseline refreshed for `src/locus/rag/embeddings/oci.py`
  (99.35% → 98.73%) to accept the intentional auto-detect branch.
- `docs/concepts/deepagent.md`: Quickstart now uses `result.parsed`
  (the actual Pydantic-typed structured-output field on `AgentResult`);
  previously referenced a non-existent `result.structured_output`. The
  Datastore auto-wiring section now points at
  `locus.rag.tools.create_rag_tool` (the factory's actual call), not
  `RAGRetriever.as_tool` (a thin wrapper that doesn't accept the
  per-store `top_k`/`threshold` overrides).

## [0.2.0b10] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed — /invoke + auth rough edges surfaced by an OCI GenAI e2e build

Four small fixes and one error-message improvement, each of which
independently blocked a real end-to-end build (orchestrator + specialists
on `oci:openai.gpt-5` in `us-chicago-1`, exposed via an `AgentServer`
behind a Fastify proxy). Each fix is gated by unit tests; the full suite
stays green (4564 passed, 3 skipped). Closes
[#191](https://github.com/oracle-samples/locus/issues/191).

- **`[oci]` extra now pulls `openai>=1.50`.** The OCI provider
  lazy-imports `openai` at request time (`OCIOpenAIModel.client`
  property); without it in the extra, a fresh
  `pip install "locus-sdk[oci]"` boots cleanly but the first
  `.complete()` raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'`.
  The OCI Generative AI service speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions wire
  protocol, so this dependency is mandatory for any consumer of the
  `[oci]` extra. Pinned alongside the `[openai]` extra.

- **`Agent.add_tool()` / `Agent.add_tools()` post-construct API.**
  `Agent.__init__` compiles `config.tools` into the runtime
  `_tool_registry` once, but the dataclass field stays writable —
  meaning post-construct mutation of `agent.config.tools` was a silent
  no-op (the model never saw the added tool). The new methods register
  on the live registry and mirror into `config.tools` so a re-init
  reconstructs the same shape. Common shape: orchestrator constructs
  first, then `Agent.as_tool(specialist)` wrappers are attached
  afterwards. The silent-mutation behaviour is now pinned by an explicit
  regression test so a future "helpful" patch can't quietly re-break it.

- **`InvokeResponse.duration_ms` is real wall time.** Previously
  hardcoded `0.0`; the `agent.run(...)` async iteration is now wrapped
  in `time.perf_counter()`. Every client-side latency metric reading the
  field was getting zeros.

- **`InvokeResponse.success` is derived from `stop_reason`.** Previously
  hardcoded `True` regardless of outcome — runs that terminated with
  `reason="error"`, `"max_iterations"`, or `"tool_loop"` came back as
  `success=true`. Now backed by a module-level
  `_INVOKE_SUCCESS_REASONS = {"complete", "confidence_met",
  "terminal_tool"}` set and an `_invoke_success(reason)` helper, both
  unit-tested. Callers can branch on the boolean without parsing the
  reason string.

- **`OCIOpenAIModel` auth-mode error is self-fixing.** The constructor
  `ValueError` for zero or two auth modes now names both valid call
  shapes (`profile='<section_from_~/.oci/config>'` for the API-key path
  vs. `auth_type='instance_principal'|'resource_principal'|
  'security_token'|'delegation_token'` together with `compartment_id=`)
  and echoes the actual `profile=` / `auth_type=` values back. Saves the
  next user a doc round-trip.

### Feat — opt-in LLM protocol picker + workbench cognitive routing

- **`LLMProtocolPicker`** — second selection mode for the cognitive
  router. Pass an instance to
  `CognitiveCompiler(protocol_picker=...)` and the model picks the
  protocol from the *filtered* candidate set (`handles ∋
  primary_goal ∧ risk_max ≥ frame.risk ∧ requires_capabilities ⊆
  caps`) instead of the rule-based `_rank_key()` tuple comparison.
  Default behaviour is **unchanged** — opt in per compiler instance.
- **Filter-then-pick invariant.** The compiler filters candidates
  with the new public `ProtocolRegistry.filter_candidates()` *before*
  the picker sees anything. If zero survive, raises
  `NoMatchingProtocolError` without an LLM call. If exactly one
  survives, returns it without an LLM call (token saving). If
  multiple survive, the picker disambiguates.
- **Safe fallback.** If the picker raises (`PickerError` /
  arbitrary exception) or returns an id not in the candidate set,
  the compiler falls back to `_rank_key()` and emits a new
  `router.protocol.picker_fallback` event. Emergent mode never
  reduces availability vs the rule-based path.
- **Observability:** `router.protocol.selected` event gains two
  fields — `method` (one of `rule_based`, `single_candidate`,
  `llm_picked`, `rule_based_fallback`) and `rationale` (the picker's
  one-sentence justification when LLM-picked). Additive — existing
  SSE consumers ignore unknown keys.
- **Workbench pattern: Cognitive routing.** New
  `/api/run/cognitive_routing` endpoint in the FastAPI runner. The
  patterns UI shows a Selection-mode segmented control (Rule-based
  ⬌ LLM picker), runs the dispatch in-process, captures the
  `method` + `rationale` off the event bus, and renders a chip
  with the protocol id + method badge + rationale callout above
  the reply.
- **UX fix:** sidebar tabs (`Tutorials | Skills | Protocols |
  Patterns`) now wrap onto a second row at narrow viewport widths
  via `flex-wrap: wrap` — the rightmost tab no longer clips off
  invisible.
- **Docs:** new `concepts/router.md#emergent-picker-opt-in-second-mode`
  section explains the filter-then-pick invariant, fallback
  contract, and `method` enum. New tutorial 59 (`Emergent routing`)
  runs both modes side-by-side. Updated `workbench.md` catalogue
  (8 → 9 patterns) with a dedicated "Cognitive routing pattern"
  subsection.
- **OG / social card wiring.** The branded
  `docs/img/og-card.png` (1280×640) shipped with the repo but was
  never injected into the docs site's head. The mkdocs Material
  `extrahead` override now emits the canonical OG + Twitter Card
  meta tag set per page, so sharing a `locusagents.oracle.com` URL
  on Slack / X / LinkedIn / Discord / Teams unfurls with the
  locus brand card and a tailored per-page title + description.
  (The GitHub repo URL's social preview is a separate setting
  that requires a one-time manual upload at the repo's Settings →
  Social preview.)

## [0.2.0b8] - 2026-05-14

### Fix — DALL-E 3 deprecation + home-page enterprise voice

- **`OpenAIImageProvider`** default model changed from `"dall-e-3"`
  (deprecated by OpenAI) to `"gpt-image-1"`. Existing callers that pin
  `model=` continue to work; only the default changed.
- Live integration test (`test_openai_image_provider_round_trip`)
  switched to `gpt-image-1` to match.
- **`docs/index.md`** rewritten in enterprise buyer voice. New
  hero copy ("Multi-agent workflows built for production."), three
  outcome-focused bullets covering production deployment,
  self-critiquing/grounded agents, and full causal traceability.
  Stat strip uses `<span style="white-space:nowrap">` wrappers on each
  protocol chip so the eight-pattern row never breaks awkwardly across
  lines.

## [0.2.0b7] - 2026-05-14

### Docs — OCI Responses surfaced across existing pages + voice pass

- **`concepts/providers/oci.md`** now lists three transports
  (`OCIOpenAIModel`, `OCIResponsesModel`, `OCIModel`) and includes
  the Responses architecture diagram + a "when to pick which" section
  cross-linked to [`concepts/oci-responses.md`](docs/concepts/oci-responses.md).
- **`how-to/oci-models.md`** transport table gains a Responses row
  plus a new "Responses transport — `OCIResponsesModel` (opt-in)"
  section covering both `store=True` (server-state) and `store=False`
  (ZDR-safe) modes.
- Both pages cross-link [tutorial 00](docs/tutorials/tutorial_01_oci_transports.md)
  (transports side-by-side), [tutorial 57](docs/tutorials/tutorial_02_oci_openai_chat.md)
  (OCIOpenAIModel deep dive) and
  [tutorial 58](docs/tutorials/tutorial_03_oci_responses.md)
  (OCIResponsesModel deep dive).
- **Voice pass** — locus is an *agentic* framework. Removed every
  occurrence of "deterministic" and "automatic" from user-facing
  docs (~50 instances across 27 files) and rewrote in active-voice
  prose. `ProtocolRegistry` is now a "typed registry / typed filter
  - rank" (still rule-based and auditable); previously "automatic"
  behaviours read as concrete subjects-and-verbs (e.g.
  "Locus picks them up natively" instead of "Locus picks them up
  automatically").
- `mkdocs build --strict` passes clean with the updated pages.

## [0.2.0b6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed — OCI Responses live-shakedown follow-ups

Caught by running the in-PR Responses code against real OCI for
streaming, multi-turn, and tool round-trip. All three fixes are
scoped to `OCIResponsesModel` + `_responses_parse.py` — no other
transport is affected.

- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR) tenancies:** OCI tenancies with ZDR
  enabled reject `previous_response_id` with `"Previous response
  cannot be used for this organization due to Zero Data Retention."`
  This broke the multi-turn value prop in every enterprise OCI
  tenancy. Added an opt-in `store: bool = True` parameter to
  `OCIResponsesModel`; setting `store=False` switches the model to
  stateless mode — it sends `store: false` in every request body,
  drops `previous_response_id`, and advertises `server_stateful=False`
  so the agent runtime sends the full message history each turn (like
  chat/completions). ZDR tenants still benefit from access to
  Responses-only models (e.g. `openai.gpt-5.5-pro`).

- **Tool round-trip via Agent:** assistant messages with tool calls
  were emitting only `message` items in the Responses input but no
  `function_call` items. When the next turn included a
  `function_call_output` (the tool result), the server returned 400
  because there was no `call_id` anchor in the input. Now emits one
  `function_call` item per tool call, in order, in
  `_responses_parse.build_request_body`. Verified live: Agent +
  `@tool` + `OCIResponsesModel(store=False)` → tool fires → result
  posted back → model produces final answer using the tool output.

- **`server_stateful` is now a per-instance property** (was
  `ClassVar`), reflecting `config.store`. Lets the same class behave
  statelessly when ZDR mode is on without forcing two classes.
  Runtime loop check switched from class-level (`type(...)`) to
  instance-level (`getattr(self._model, ...) is True`) — still
  MagicMock-safe because `Mock object is True → False`.

Live wire-format coverage now includes: streaming end-to-end against
gpt-5 (events, content deltas, completed event), two-turn stateless
continuation (recalls user-shared facts from full history), and tool
round-trip with real OCI returning a final answer derived from tool
output.

## [0.2.0b1 → 0.2.0b5] - 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-14

Cumulative entries from the first five betas, kept together because the
release tags did not have one-to-one CHANGELOG sections at the time.
Individual MR numbers in parentheses anchor each item to its source change.

### Added

- `OCIResponsesModel` — third OCI transport, opt-in, for the OCI
  Generative AI **Responses API** (`/openai/v1/responses`). Server-
  stateful: the OCI side holds the conversation thread between turns
  and Locus references it via `previous_response_id`. Use it for
  Responses-only OCI models (e.g. `openai.gpt-5.5-pro`) and for runs
  where re-sending the full history each turn is wasteful. Auth surface
  identical to `OCIOpenAIModel` (`profile=` for API key / session,
  `auth_type="instance_principal" | "resource_principal"` for workload
  identity). **Project OCID stays optional** — only required when a
  specific Responses feature demands it, in which case
  `OCIProjectRequiredError` points the caller at the constructor kwarg.
  Expired/unknown continuation tokens raise `OCIResponsesStateLostError` so
  resuming agents fail loud instead of silently dropping conversation.
  See [`docs/concepts/oci-responses.md`](docs/concepts/oci-responses.md).
- **Plumbing for server-stateful providers:** new
  `ModelResponse.provider_state` and `AgentState.provider_state` fields
  thread an opaque continuation token between turns. Stateless
  providers ignore them — default `None`, zero behavior change. The
  runtime loop detects `model.server_stateful` and sends only the
  message slice added since the last assistant turn, skipping
  `ConversationManager` strategies (which have nothing to operate on
  when the history is server-side). Every other Locus primitive —
  memory injection, Reflexion, GSAR, grounding, idempotency dedup,
  tool/model/invocation hooks, checkpointer, output schema, streaming,
  termination conditions — works identically on both transports.

- `AfterToolCallEvent.tool_call_id` and `AfterToolCallEvent.arguments` —
  read-only fields on the after-tool-call hook event. Lets a single
  `on_after_tool_call` hook correlate with the matching
  `BeforeToolCallEvent` and observe the exact arguments the tool ran
  with (post-hook mutation). Closes the gap between locus and peer
  frameworks (Claude Code `PostToolUse`, OpenAI Agents `on_tool_end`,
  Vercel `onStepFinish`, Strands `AfterToolCallEvent`) — see
  [`docs/concepts/hooks.md`](docs/concepts/hooks.md#on_after_tool_call--what-the-event-carries).
  Primary use case: mirroring tool calls into a host-side action queue
  (e.g. MCP integrations whose real side effect runs out of process).
  Additive — existing constructors / hook implementations keep working
  without changes; new fields are keyword-only with defaults of `""`
  and `{}`.

- `OCIOpenAIModel` — second OCI transport against the OpenAI-compatible
  `/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Wraps the standard `openai` SDK,
  inherits `OpenAIModel` for parsing/streaming/tool conversion, signs
  requests with an inline `httpx.Auth` wrapper around the existing OCI
  signers (no new dependencies). Real SSE streaming, day-0 model support,
  OpenAI-standard request shape; covers OpenAI / Meta / xAI / Mistral /
  Gemini families. Auth modes: `profile=` (laptop / CI),
  `auth_type="instance_principal" | "resource_principal"` (OCI workload
  identity). Compartment auto-derived from the profile's tenancy. No
  Responses API and no GenAI Project OCID — locus owns conversation state
  and tool execution. `OCIModel` (OCI SDK transport) remains the path for
  Cohere R-series. The string factory `model="oci:..."` auto-routes by
  family. See [`docs/how-to/oci-models.md`](docs/how-to/oci-models.md).
  (MR !70)
- `@tool(idempotent=True)` — declarative deduplication in the Execute
  node. When the model re-issues the same `(name, arguments)` tuple
  within a run, the prior result is reused instead of the tool firing
  again. (MR !46)
- `get_today_date` — built-in tool that returns today, tomorrow, the
  next seven weekdays, and week offsets as ISO dates, so models can
  resolve relative dates without asking. (MR !46)
- `anthropic` and `ollama` optional-dependency extras were missing from
  `pyproject.toml` even though the provider modules shipped. Added both
  plus a `models` bundle (`openai,anthropic,ollama,oci`); the `all`
  bundle now transitively pulls through `models`. (MR !49)
- `oci_bucket_config` session-scoped conftest fixture for integration
  tests; documents each `OCI_*` env var consumers must set. (MR !48)
- End-to-end `TestAgentWithOCIBucketBackend` — runs an `Agent` turn,
  throws the instance away, creates a brand-new `Agent` against the
  same `thread_id`, and asserts the conversation resumes from the
  bucket. (MR !48)

### Changed

- `examples/config.py` and the `oci:` string-factory entry in
  `locus.models.registry` now route OCI model ids by family —
  `cohere.command-r-*` flows through `OCIModel`, everything else
  through `OCIOpenAIModel`. Existing tutorials inherit the new
  transport without edits. Override with
  `LOCUS_OCI_TRANSPORT=v1|sdk`. (MR !70)
- `OpenAIModel` reasoning-family detection now tolerates OCI-style
  namespace prefixes (`openai.gpt-5.5` → recognised as `gpt-5*`,
  `max_completion_tokens` used). (MR !70)
- `OpenAIModel` no longer sends `presence_penalty` /
  `frequency_penalty` when they're at their default `0.0` — xAI Grok
  rejects either parameter outright. Server defaults are 0.0 anyway,
  so omission is functionally equivalent for providers that accept
  them. (MR !70)
- `OpenAIModel._parse_response` and `OpenAIModel.stream` now guard
  against `choice.message=None`, `message.content=None`, and
  `choice.delta=None`, which Gemini emits for filtered or empty
  responses. (MR !70)
- `OCIBucketBackend` now implements `BaseCheckpointer` directly and
  can be passed to `Agent(checkpointer=...)` without
  `StorageBackendAdapter` wrapping. The native object layout is
  `{prefix}/{thread_id}/{checkpoint_id}.json` plus a `.meta.json`
  sibling and a `_latest` pointer. (MR !48)
- README rewritten for accuracy: badges match measured test counts
  (2500+ unit / 270+ integration); the misleading `mypy-100%` claim
  replaced with `mypy-checked`; feature matrix moved to
  `docs/FEATURES.md`. (MR !50)

### Removed

- `src/locus/cli/` — the 14-line stub whose `main()` printed
  `"Locus CLI - coming soon"`. Dead code masquerading as SDK surface.
  Along with it: `[project.scripts]`, ruff/mypy/coverage overrides
  that only existed to silence the stub. (MR !49)

### Fixed

- Multi-turn Cohere conversations on OCI now preserve historical
  `tool_results` in `chat_history` so the model sees prior tool
  outputs instead of re-asking for data it already has. (MR !45)
- `no_tools` termination no longer fires on an unanswered user
  message — the loop now recognises an unreplied user turn as a
  signal to continue, not to stop. (MR !45)

## [0.1.0] — initial publishable cut

First internal-review version. Core shape established:

- `Agent`, `@tool`, `AgentState`, `Message`, `Role`, typed streaming
  events (`ThinkEvent`, `ToolStartEvent`, `ToolCompleteEvent`,
  `ReflectEvent`, `TerminateEvent`).
- ReAct loop (Think / Execute / Reflect) with planning, reflexion,
  grounding, and completion-mode controls.
- `BaseCheckpointer` abstraction and `MemoryCheckpointer`,
  `FileCheckpointer`, `HTTPCheckpointer` implementations.

  `BaseCheckpointer` in subsequent MRs): Redis, PostgreSQL,
  OpenSearch, Oracle, OCI Object Storage — wrapped via
  `StorageBackendAdapter`.
- Model providers: OCI GenAI (Cohere, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, Google,
  Mistral), OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama.
- Multi-agent: Swarm, orchestrator/specialist, handoff, graph

  API (`@entrypoint` / `@task`).
- Graph features: conditional edges, subgraphs, Send API (map-reduce),
  per-node `RetryPolicy` and `CachePolicy`, Mermaid + ASCII
  visualization.
- RAG: 8 vector stores, embeddings (OCI Cohere, OpenAI), multimodal
  retrieval.
- Hooks: write-protected events, cancel/retry control flow, reverse
  ordering, plugin system; five built-in hooks (logging, retry,
  guardrails, steering, telemetry).
- Guardrails depth: PII detection, SQL/XSS/command-injection detection,
  topic policy, content safety, output filtering.
- Steering: LLM-powered real-time tool approval.
- Skills: AgentSkills.io-compatible `SKILL.md` with progressive
  disclosure.
- Evaluation: `EvalCase`, `EvalRunner`, `EvalReport`.
