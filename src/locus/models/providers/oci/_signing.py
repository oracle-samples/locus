"""httpx.Auth wrapper that signs requests with an OCI signer.

Used by :class:`OCIOpenAIModel` for IAM authentication against OCI's
OpenAI-compatible ``/openai/v1`` endpoint.

We deliberately don't depend on ``requests``, ``oci-openai``, or
``oci-genai-auth-python`` for this. The OCI signer interface only reads
``method``, ``url``, ``path_url``, ``headers``, and ``body`` from the
prepared request, so we duck-type those from an ``httpx.Request`` and skip
the ``requests`` round-trip entirely.

    Works with any ``oci.signer.AbstractBaseSigner`` subclass — user
    principal (API key signing), security token (session), instance
    principal, or resource principal — so a single ``http_client`` can
    be reused regardless of which IAM mode the caller picked.

    For token-based signers that rotate (session, instance/resource
    principal), pass a ``refresh_signer`` callback that refreshes the
    underlying signer. The auth flow will:

    - Periodically refresh on a timer (``refresh_interval`` seconds).
    - Refresh and retry once on a 401 response.

    The callback can either mutate the current signer in place (typical
    for instance/resource principals whose ``refresh_security_token``
    method updates the signer's internal token) **or** return a brand-new
    signer that should replace the current one (typical for session-token
    signers that are immutable but need to be rebuilt from a refreshed
    ``security_token_file`` on disk). Return-value handling: if the
    callback returns anything that exposes ``do_request_sign``, the
    wrapper swaps to it; otherwise the existing in-place mutation is
    assumed.
