"""Tutorial 48: Checkpoint backends on Oracle Autonomous Database 26ai.

The checkpointer contract is backend-agnostic, but the production
recommendation on OCI is Oracle 26ai — native JSON columns, vector and
text indexes in one schema, and the full capability set (list_threads,
search, vacuum) over a single durable store. Tutorial 06 covers the
checkpointer contract itself; this tutorial drives it against a real
ADB.

- Save and load AgentState via oracle_checkpointer.
- Inspect the reported capabilities.
- Walk thread history with list_threads / list_checkpoints.
- Vacuum old checkpoints with OracleBackend.vacuum.
- Full-text search across stored conversations.

Run it
    # Requires a running Autonomous Database with its wallet on disk:
    export ORACLE_DSN=mydb_low                   # tnsnames alias
    export ORACLE_USER=locus_app                 # least-privileged
    export ORACLE_PASSWORD='<app-password>'
    export ORACLE_WALLET=~/.oci/wallets/mydb
    export ORACLE_WALLET_PASSWORD='<wallet-pw>'  # if encrypted
    python examples/tutorial_48_checkpoint_backends.py

Without the env vars the tutorial prints what's missing and exits cleanly
so CI stays green. The in-memory checkpointer covered in tutorial 06 is
the developer default; Oracle 26ai is the production recommendation.
