"""Notebook 49: Evaluation — score an agent against a test suite.

Treat the agent like any other piece of code. Declare cases, run them,
read the report. Locus ships a small, dependency-free harness so you
don't need an external eval framework for the common cases.

- EvalCase declares prompt plus expected substrings (positive or negative).
- EvalRunner runs the agent against every case.
- EvalReport summarises pass/fail counts and an average score.
