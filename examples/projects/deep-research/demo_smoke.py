"""End-to-end smoke test of locus.deepagent.create_deepagent(datastores=...).

Mirrors the shape of langchain-oci's `create_deep_research_agent()` gist
but stays entirely on locus primitives:

    OCIEmbeddings + InMemoryVectorStore + RAGRetriever
        |
        v
    create_deepagent(datastores={"medical": retriever}, max_output_tokens=...)
        |
        v
    agent.run_sync("write a memo on iron metabolism")

Validates:
- `cohere.embed-v4.0` auto-detects to 1536 dims (no enum entry needed).
- `datastores=` auto-wires a `search_medical` tool + datastore description
  block in the system prompt.
- `max_output_tokens=` lands on the per-completion request.

Run:
    OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID=... uv run python examples/projects/deep-research/demo_smoke.py

    "Iron is absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Heme iron from "
    "animal sources is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plants.",
    "Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis, produced by the liver "
    "in response to iron stores and inflammation. It blocks iron export from "
    "enterocytes and macrophages by degrading ferroportin.",
    "Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, "
    "affecting an estimated 1.2 billion people. Diagnostic markers include low "
    "ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and microcytic hypochromic RBCs.",
    "Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the HFE gene (most "
    "commonly C282Y homozygosity), leading to excessive intestinal iron "
    "absorption and tissue iron overload affecting the liver, heart, and pancreas.",
    "Treatment for iron deficiency typically begins with oral ferrous sulfate "
    "325mg three times daily. IV iron is indicated for malabsorption, "
    "intolerance, or rapid replacement needs.",
    "Transferrin is the main iron transport protein in plasma, binding two ferric "
    "ions per molecule. Transferrin saturation below 16% suggests iron deficiency.",
    "Ferritin is the primary iron storage protein, sequestering up to 4500 iron "
    "atoms per molecule. Serum ferritin reflects total body iron stores but is "
    "an acute-phase reactant elevated by inflammation.",
    "Phlebotomy is the first-line treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis, "
    "removing roughly 200-250mg of iron per unit of blood. Therapeutic target is "
    "ferritin <50 ng/mL.",
    "Anemia of chronic disease results from elevated hepcidin in inflammatory "
    "states, sequestering iron in macrophages. Typically presents as normocytic "
    "with elevated ferritin and low transferrin saturation.",
    "Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is caused by mutations in "
    "TMPRSS6 leading to inappropriately elevated hepcidin and poor response to "
    "oral iron supplementation. IV iron is the mainstay of treatment.",
