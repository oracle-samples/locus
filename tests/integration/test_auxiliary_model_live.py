"""Live: ``Agent(auxiliary_model=...)`` routes side calls correctly.

Drives a real two-iteration agent against OCI v1 with a small primary model
and an even smaller auxiliary model, then asserts the auxiliary model
received at least one call (the max-iterations summary). The auxiliary
acts as the cheap-tier helper so the primary's budget stays for the
actual task.
