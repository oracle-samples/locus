# Evaluation

Treat the agent like any other piece of code. Declare cases, run them,
read the report. Locus ships a small, dependency-free harness so you
don't need an external eval framework for the common cases.

- `EvalCase` declares prompt plus expected substrings (positive or negative).
- `EvalRunner` runs the agent against every case.
- `EvalReport` summarises pass/fail counts and an average score.

Run it (OCI Generative AI is the default; auto-detected from `~/.oci/config`):
