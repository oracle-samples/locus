# StateGraph

`StateGraph` is the **explicit-control-flow** shape: nodes do work,
edges decide what runs next, and state flows through. Cycles
(retry-until-confidence), conditional branches, and subgraphs are
all first-class.

![StateGraph pattern — START → plan → research → write → review → END, with a conditional loop-back from review to research when confidence < 0.85](../../img/patterns/graph.svg){ .diagram }

## What it is

- **`StateGraph(state_schema=...)`** — a builder bound to a typed
  state shape (your own dataclass or BaseModel).
- **`add_node(name, agent_or_callable)`** — a unit of work.
- **`add_edge(src, dst)`** — unconditional transition.
- **`add_conditional_edges(src, fn)`** — `fn(state) → next_node_name`
  picks the next node dynamically.
- **`compile()`** — produces a runnable graph; `run` and `run_sync`
  walk like any agent.

State is a typed value object with custom **reducers** that control
how each node's output merges into shared fields.

## When to use it

- ✅ The flow has **cycles** — review-loop, retry, refine-until-confidence.
- ✅ You want **explicit, inspectable control flow** with a Mermaid
  diagram you can paste into a design doc.
- ✅ You need **per-node retry / cache policies** (different policies
  per node).
- ✅ **Subgraphs** — encapsulate a sub-workflow as a single node.

## When NOT to use it

- ❌ The flow is a **straight pipe** with maybe a fan-out → use
  [Composition](composition.md).
- ❌ You don't know the flow at design time; agents should
  **self-organise** → use [Swarm](swarm.md).
- ❌ A central agent should **decide which expert runs next** → use
  [Orchestrator](orchestrator.md).

## Code

```python
from locus.multiagent import StateGraph, END
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResearchState(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    research_notes: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    draft: str = ""
    confidence: float = 0.0

graph = StateGraph(state_schema=ResearchState)

graph.add_node("plan", plan_agent)
graph.add_node("research", research_agent)
graph.add_node("write", write_agent)
graph.add_node("review", review_agent)

graph.add_edge("plan", "research")
graph.add_edge("research", "write")
graph.add_edge("write", "review")

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "review",
    lambda state: END if state.confidence >= 0.85 else "research",
)

result = graph.compile().run_sync({"prompt": "Write a launch brief."})
print(result.draft)
```

## Per-node policies

```python
from locus.multiagent.graph import RetryPolicy, CachePolicy

graph.add_node(
    "research",
    research_agent,
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3, backoff="exponential"),
    cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl_seconds=3600),
)
```

Retries handle transient failures inside the node. Cache
short-circuits when an identical input has been seen recently
(useful for expensive deterministic nodes).

## Send / SendBatch — fan-out inside a graph

For map/reduce inside a graph use the `Send` primitive from
`locus.core.send`:

```python
from locus.core.send import Send

def fan_out_review(state):
    return [Send("review_one", {"vendor": v}) for v in state.vendors]

graph.add_conditional_edges("plan", fan_out_review)
graph.add_node("review_one", review_one_vendor_agent)
graph.add_edge("review_one", "merge")
graph.add_node("merge", merge_reviews_agent)
```

Each `Send` becomes a parallel invocation of the target node with
the given partial state. The merge node sees all results.

## Mermaid visualisation

```python
graph.compile().get_mermaid()
```

…returns a Mermaid flowchart string you can paste into the docs or
a design review.
