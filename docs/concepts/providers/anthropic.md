# Anthropic

The Anthropic provider connects locus directly to Anthropic's API
(`api.anthropic.com`). Use it when you want **the Claude family** —
Opus for the hardest problems, Sonnet as the everyday workhorse,
Haiku for high-volume cheap calls — and want to talk to Anthropic
without going through an intermediary.

Two things make this provider distinct: **prompt caching** (long
system prompts and tool blocks pay 1/10th the input cost on repeat
turns) and **extended thinking** (Claude 4 surfaces its reasoning as
a stream of typed events your UI can render).

## When to pick Anthropic

| You want… | This is the right provider |
|---|---|
| Claude Opus / Sonnet / Haiku from Anthropic directly | ✓ |
| Long system prompts amortised across many turns | ✓ — automatic prompt caching |
| Extended-thinking models with visible reasoning | ✓ — `ThinkEvent` stream |
| Claude on Oracle infrastructure (no separate API key) | use [OCI](oci.md) — `oci:anthropic.claude-sonnet` |
| GPT or Llama | use [OpenAI](openai.md) or [OCI](oci.md) instead |

## Getting started

### 1. Set your API key

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 2. Pick a Claude model

```python
from locus import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
)
```

The string `"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` tells locus the
provider (`anthropic:`) and the exact model id. Any model id
Anthropic accepts, locus accepts — including the dated revision
suffixes (`-20250514`).

### 3. Run it

```python
result = agent.run_sync("Summarise the design doc in three bullets.")
print(result.message)
```

That's the full setup. Streaming, tool calling, prompt caching, and
extended thinking work without extra configuration.

## What you get out of the box

### The whole Claude family

Whatever Anthropic ships, you can address by name:

| Model | When to pick it |
|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-…` | Hardest problems — code archaeology, deep research, multi-step reasoning |
| `claude-sonnet-4-…` | Everyday workhorse — fast enough, smart enough, cheap enough |
| `claude-haiku-4-…` | High-volume cheap calls — classification, routing, simple summaries |

### Real SSE streaming

Token-level streaming. The model emits content deltas; locus
converts them to `ModelChunkEvent`s; your `async for` loop reads
them as they arrive.

```python
async for event in agent.run("Write a haiku about latency."):
    if isinstance(event, ModelChunkEvent) and event.content:
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Tool calling — the Anthropic tool-use protocol

`@tool` functions are translated into Anthropic's `tools` schema; the
model's structured `tool_use` blocks are parsed back into locus
`ToolCall`s. Parallel tool calls are supported (the model can
request multiple tools per turn; locus runs them concurrently via
the `ConcurrentExecutor`).

### Structured output — tool-as-schema

Anthropic doesn't expose a `response_format` field, so locus uses
the standard "single-tool" trick: define the schema as a tool, force
the model to call it. From your side, the API is identical to the
other providers:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Triage(BaseModel):
    severity: str
    needs_human: bool

agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    output_schema=Triage,
)
result = agent.run_sync("This page is broken!")
print(result.parsed)        # Triage(severity='high', needs_human=True)
```

### Prompt caching — automatic for long prompts

This is the biggest cost saver if your system prompt or tool block is
long (skills, playbooks, RAG context). Anthropic's prompt-caching
mechanism marks a span of the request as cacheable; subsequent turns
within the cache window pay **1/10th** the input cost on the cached
span.

locus reads the request shape and applies `cache_control` to anything
beyond a small threshold automatically. You don't opt in.

```python
# Force or suppress caching explicitly:
agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    model_config={"prompt_cache": True},   # or False to opt out
)
```

When it kicks in:

- A 5-minute "ephemeral" cache (rolling window) — the default.
- Subsequent turns reusing the same prefix pay `0.1× input rate` on
  the cached portion.
- Effective when system prompts > ~1024 tokens, or you've loaded a
  big skill / playbook / RAG block.

### Extended thinking — visible reasoning

Claude 4 models with `thinking_enabled` think before answering, the
way the OpenAI o-series does. Anthropic surfaces those thinking
blocks in the response; locus emits a `ThinkEvent` for each one so
your UI can show what the model is working on:

```python
async for event in agent.run("..."):
    match event:
        case ThinkEvent(reasoning=r) if r:
            print(f"💭 {r}")
        case ModelChunkEvent(content=c) if c:
            print(c, end="", flush=True)
```

## Claude on OCI — same model, different provider

Don't have an Anthropic API key? Want Claude billed through your
Oracle account on Oracle infrastructure? Switch the prefix:

```python
agent = Agent(model="oci:anthropic.claude-sonnet", ...)
```

That routes through `OCIOpenAIModel` against the OCI Generative AI
endpoint (uses `OCI_PROFILE` for auth, no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed).
Same model behind it; different billing surface.

## Common gotchas

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `401 authentication_error` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set, or set to a key without console access |
| `404 not_found_error` on the model id | Dated revision suffix is wrong; check `https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models` |
| `429 overloaded_error` | Anthropic capacity; the `ModelRetryHook` re-tries with backoff if installed |
| Prompt caching not visible in usage stats | Cache window expired (5 min ephemeral) or prompt below the threshold |
| `ThinkEvent`s never fire | Model not in the extended-thinking subset, or `thinking_enabled` not set in `model_config` |
