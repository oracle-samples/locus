# Agent Hooks

Hooks are middleware for agents. Subclass `HookProvider`, override the
callbacks you need, and Locus invokes them at four lifecycle points:
before/after the invocation, and before/after each tool call. Use them
to add logging, timing, validation, guardrails, or any cross-cutting
concern without touching the agent or its tools.

What you'll learn:

- Writing a `HookProvider` and registering it on an `Agent`.
- The four callback points and what they receive.
- Using `HookPriority` to control execution order.
- Mutating `event.arguments` from `on_before_tool_call` to rewrite the
  call before the tool runs.
- Composing several hooks on one agent.

Run it:

```
.venv/bin/python examples/tutorial_12_agent_hooks.py
```

Uses the OCI Generative AI default provider (canonical id:
`openai.gpt-4.1` or `meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct`). For offline runs set
`LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock`; OpenAI, Anthropic and Ollama also work.

Prerequisite: tutorial 11.
