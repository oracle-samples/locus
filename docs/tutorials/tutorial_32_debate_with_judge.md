# Adversarial debate with a structured-output judge

PRO and CON take turns arguing a resolution. After N rounds a Judge
reads the full transcript and emits a typed `Verdict` — winner,
confidence, key points, reasoning — that downstream systems (tickets,
audit logs, databases) can consume directly.

This tutorial covers:

- `Turn(side, round, text)` accumulated into a `list[Turn]` in graph
  state — the transcript.
- `output_schema=Verdict` on the judge Agent, so `result.parsed` is a
  populated Pydantic object, not a JSON string.
- The judge node raises rather than fabricating a verdict if the
  configured model can't honor the schema.
- `check_structured_output_capable()` short-circuits the tutorial with
  setup guidance when running under the mock model or a model without
  constrained-decoding support.

```text
PRO r0 → CON r0 → PRO r1 → CON r1 → ... → judge → END
```

## Prerequisites

- Tutorial 13 (structured output).
- Tutorial 16 (basic graph).

## Run

```bash
python examples/tutorial_32_debate_with_judge.py
```

The default provider is OCI Generative AI. Pick a model that supports
constrained JSON decoding (canonical: `openai.gpt-4.1` or
`openai.gpt-5`). Under `LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` the tutorial exits
cleanly with setup instructions.
