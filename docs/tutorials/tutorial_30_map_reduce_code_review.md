# Map-reduce code review — scatter-gather with the `Send` primitive

Three source files, three reviewer roles (security, performance,
style) = nine reviewer agents running in parallel, then one
synthesizer collapses everything into a single Markdown report.

This tutorial covers:

- `Send(node, payload, metadata)` — first-class graph primitive. The
  splitter returns a list of Sends; the executor fans them out
  concurrently. No queues, no manual `asyncio.gather`.
- Each reviewer is a distinct `Agent` with a role-specific system
  prompt. The graph orchestrates them, not a hand-rolled loop.
- The synthesizer reads each Send's output back from merged state and
  renders the final Markdown report.
- The whole pipeline is one `StateGraph.execute` call — streaming,
  cancellation, checkpointing, and GSAR judgment all attach for free.

## Prerequisites

- Tutorial 16 (basic graph).
- Tutorial 24 (Swarm) for the dynamic-claim counterpoint.

## Run

```bash
python examples/tutorial_30_map_reduce_code_review.py
```

The default provider is OCI Generative AI. With `~/.oci/config`
present the reviewers talk to a live OCI model; canonical picks are
`openai.gpt-4.1` or `meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct`. Set
`LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` for offline runs.
