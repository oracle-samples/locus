# Multi-Agent HITL

Tutorial 19 covered HITL for a single agent. Production systems
typically combine a triage agent, several specialists, and a human
gate for irreversible actions. This tutorial walks three combinations.

## Patterns

- **Pattern A — Approval gate**: triage classifies a refund, a
  specialist drafts the response, a human approves before it ships.
- **Pattern B — Human-as-tool**: when triage isn't confident, it asks
  the human for the category instead of guessing. The answer becomes
  part of state for downstream specialists.
- **Pattern C — Long-pause workflow**: state survives across an
  interrupt boundary so the human can come back hours later (different
  process, different caller) and the workflow resumes.

## What the primitives do

- `interrupt(payload)` — function-level pause. Any node can call it.
  The graph catches the `InterruptException`, snapshots state, and
  returns an `InterruptState` to the caller.
- `graph.execute(Command(resume=<answer>, update=state))` — resume
  from the interrupt. The `interrupt()` call returns the resume value.
- Pair with a checkpointer for multi-process / multi-day pauses that
  preserve every specialist's context.

## Prerequisites

- Tutorial 16 (basic graph).
- Tutorial 19 (single-agent HITL).

## Run

```bash
python examples/tutorial_33_multiagent_human_in_loop.py
```

The default provider is OCI Generative AI. With `~/.oci/config`
present the specialists talk to a live OCI model; canonical picks are
`openai.gpt-4.1` or `meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct`. Set
`LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` for offline runs.
