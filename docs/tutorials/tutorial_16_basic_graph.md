# Basic graph

Build a workflow as a graph of nodes that pass state to each other. A
`StateGraph` is a directed graph where each node is an async function
that takes the current state in and returns updates to merge back. Use
it when one Agent isn't enough — multi-step pipelines, branching
logic, fan-out / fan-in, human approval gates.

What you'll see:

- Nodes and edges; `START` and `END` sentinels.
- Sequential, parallel, and conditional flow on the same primitives.
- `GraphResult` — final state plus per-node status, timing, and order.
- Streaming node updates and pushing custom progress events from inside a node.
- An Agent embedded inside a graph node.

Runs on the same OCI GenAI default as the rest of the tutorials:
